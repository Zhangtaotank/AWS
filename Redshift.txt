## Data Ingestion: Depulication/Upsert

Begin;
CREATE TEMP TABLE staging(LIKE deep_dive);
COPY staging FROM 'S3://bucket/dd.csv'
:'creds' COMPUPDATE OFF;  --Turn off automatic compression
DELETE FROM deep_dive d 
USING staging s WHERE d.aid = s.aid;
INSERT INTO deep_dive SELECT * FROM staging;
DROP TABLE staging;
COMMIT;

## ETL vs ELT
ETL: Read data from a source, perform any desired changes, and then write it to a target. 
     tools: such as DataStage, Informatica, or SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS). 
ELT: Instead of transforming the data before itâ€™s written, ELT leverages the target system to do the transformation. The data is copied to the target and then transformed in place.
